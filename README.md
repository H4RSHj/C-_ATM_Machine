# C-_ATM_Machine
Title: ATM Machine Simulation using C++

Description: As part of my programming coursework, I implemented a simulation of an ATM machine using C++ and object-oriented programming concepts. The project involved defining classes such as atm, userdetails, and showdetails, which were responsible for displaying the current balance, enabling users to withdraw or deposit cash, and keeping track of account details such as usernames, passwords, and account status. I utilized a switch statement to handle user input and implemented error handling for incorrect inputs. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in C++ programming and OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Technologies used: C++, Object-Oriented Programming
